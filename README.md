# Modelling-infant-ICU-stays-and-outcomes
Final project for my statistical analysis course. Cox proportional hazard modelling of length of preterm infant stays in ICU based on admission diagnoses, and multinomial modelling of discharge location based on diagnoses.  
Caveats:  
- Diagnosis category of 'cardiac hemorrhage' should be read as 'organ hemorrhage' throughout the document. This wording error was only realized after submission. 
- Due to an error in data wrangling, the study population is infants who had been hospitalized for 48 days or more (I had meant this to be 48 hours... but this is just a screw up). So our results are less generalizable, and inferences only apply to this population. This was only caught after submission. This also results in very few death outcomes.
